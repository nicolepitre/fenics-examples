    "#### June 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to:\n",
    "- Create a Gmsh script file (.geo file)\n",
    "- Generate a finite element mesh from a .geo file\n",
    "- Convert a mesh into XML format using dolfin-convert\n",
    "- Mark subdomains of a mesh\n",
    "- Include a mesh [and its subdomains] in a FEniCS demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Gmsh script file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in generating a finite element mesh is to write a Gmsh script file that specifies the desired geometry. For more information on writing Gmsh script files including a list of all available geometry commands, see the Gmsh Reference Manual: http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by looking at an example of a Gmsh script file called cape.geo. We will then open the file in Gmsh to see the physical representation of the code.\n"
