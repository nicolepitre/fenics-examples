# fenics-examples
A collection of FEniCS examples that show simple ways to use FEniCS to solve PDEs. Written in Python.

This repository contains examples of Python code for FEniCS. It also contains geometry files that are written in the Gmsh scripting language. All files with the .geo extension can be displayed in Gmsh. The corresponding mesh files (.msh extension) are contained in the folder called meshes. The XML versions of the meshes are contained in the folder called xml-meshes. Any file with the .py extension should be run inside of FEniCS, including the dolfin-convert script.
